# Catch Me If You Can

A web-based game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, incorporating **Bootstrap** and **jQuery** for enhanced design and functionality. The game challenges users to catch an elusive animal image that constantly evades the mouse pointer.

## Features
1. **Dynamic Animal Selection**:
   - A Bootstrap navigation bar allows users to switch between a cat, dog, and tiger image.

2. **Mouse Evasion Animation**:
   - The animal image moves dynamically along the perimeter of the web page, avoiding the user's mouse pointer.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - The game adjusts to different screen sizes for desktop devices.

4. **Game Title**:
   - "Catch Me If You Can" is displayed prominently in the center of the web page.

## Rules
- The animal image will continuously move to maintain a fixed distance from the mouse pointer.
- The mouse pointer cannot "catch" the animal from any direction.
- The game is designed for desktop browsers and may not function on mobile devices.
